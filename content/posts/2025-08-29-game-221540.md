Capcom has officially put to rest the fan theories suggesting that its upcoming sci-fi game, Pragmata, is a secret revival of the beloved Mega Man franchise. Producer Naoto Oyama confirmed that Pragmata is a completely new IP, despite the intriguing design similarities between its robotic sidekick, Diana, and the iconic Mega Man character. This revelation comes as a relief to many who have been eagerly awaiting new content from Capcom, especially after the long hiatus since Mega Man 11.

While fans have expressed excitement over the potential connections between Pragmata and Mega Man, Oyama's comments highlight Capcom's commitment to exploring new narratives and gameplay experiences. The company has reiterated its respect for the Mega Man series and is actively considering ways to bring it back in the future. With Pragmata set for release in 2026, anticipation is building for what this unique title will bring to the gaming landscape.

As we look forward to Pragmata's launch, one can't help but wonder: what new adventures and stories await us in this original universe? Will it capture the hearts of gamers as Mega Man once did, or will it carve out its own legacy?
