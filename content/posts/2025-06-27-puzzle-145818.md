Capcom has unveiled an intriguing glimpse into its upcoming title, Pragmata, showcasing a unique blend of puzzle-solving and shooting mechanics that promises to redefine gameplay in the sci-fi genre. The first gameplay reveal, which aired during a recent live stream, highlights players hacking robots through a mini-game while simultaneously engaging in combatâ€”a dual challenge that could elevate the gaming experience to new heights.

Set in a near-future lunar research station in crisis, players will step into the shoes of Hugh, a skilled spaceman, alongside his android companion Diana, who intriguingly resembles a human child. This dynamic duo is poised to navigate a world filled with challenges, and early impressions from media previews suggest that Pragmata's polished gameplay and innovative mechanics leave players eager for more.

Originally announced back in June 2020, Pragmata has faced several delays, with a release now slated for 2026. However, with Capcom's strong track record in delivering quality experiences, there's a growing sense of anticipation surrounding how these unique gameplay elements will unfold over what is expected to be a lengthy adventure. Will Pragmata set a new standard for the genre, or will it face the challenges of execution? Only time will tell.
