In a surprising turn of events, Amazon Games has confirmed that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will officially go offline on January 31, 2027. This announcement follows the company's decision to step away from MMO development, leading to the game's delisting on January 15, 2026. Players will still have access to their purchased game, but the servers will cease to operate, marking the end of an era for fans of this ambitious title.

The game has already been removed from storefronts, including Steam and the Xbox store, and players will no longer be able to purchase in-game currency starting July 20, 2026. Amazon expressed gratitude towards the community, acknowledging the dedication and passion that players have shown throughout the game's lifecycle. They emphasized their commitment to providing a memorable sendoff for the game, which has fostered a unique world and community.

As we approach the final year of New World: Aeternum, players are left to reflect on their adventures and the impact the game has had on the MMO landscape. What will you remember most about your time in Aeternum?
