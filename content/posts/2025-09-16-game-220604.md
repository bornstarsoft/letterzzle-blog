Sega's latest ad for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds cleverly resurrects the nostalgic 'blast processing' campaign from the '90s, reigniting the age-old rivalry with Nintendo. The ad playfully critiques Mario Kart World, showcasing Sonic Racing's traditional karting structure as a refreshing alternative to Nintendo's open-world approach. 

With a voiceover that dismissively references Mario Kart World, the ad emphasizes Sonic Racing's promise of speed and straightforward gameplay. This strategic move not only appeals to long-time Sega fans but also positions Sonic Racing as a viable competitor in the kart racing genre, especially as Mario Kart World shifts its focus. 

As gaming enthusiasts, we can't help but wonder: will Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds successfully carve out its niche in a landscape dominated by Mario Kart, or will it merely serve as a nostalgic nod to the past?
