The gaming community is buzzing with excitement as Xbox and Obsidian announce that their action RPG, Avowed, is set to launch on PlayStation 5 next month. This release, scheduled for February 17, coincides with an anniversary update that promises to enhance the gameplay experience significantly. New features like New Game Plus mode, additional races, new weapon types, and a Photo Mode will be available, making it a must-play for both new and returning players.

Avowed, originally released on Xbox consoles and PC, is a first-person fantasy RPG set in the richly detailed world of Eora, which fans may recognize from Obsidians Pillars of Eternity franchise. The developers have described the anniversary update as providing a "more rounded experience" compared to the original game, which is sure to intrigue players looking for depth and variety in their gaming adventures.

As Obsidian continues to expand its portfolio with titles like The Outer Worlds 2 and Grounded 2, the arrival of Avowed on PS5 marks a significant step in Microsoft's strategy of making its games accessible across multiple platforms. With the gaming landscape constantly evolving, one can't help but wonder how this trend will shape the future of game development and player engagement.
