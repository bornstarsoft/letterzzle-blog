Agni Flare Inc. has just extended the Steam Playtest for their exciting new title, SHIKA-Q, until February 1, 2026, due to an overwhelming response from players around the globe. This ultra-high-speed competitive puzzle game promises a unique blend of strategy and real-time action, setting it apart from traditional puzzle games. Players can dive into the core gameplay elements, including an engaging Offline Versus mode and a Challenge Mode that allows for high-score competition up to Level 20.

What makes SHIKA-Q particularly intriguing is its innovative gameplay mechanics that combine puzzle-solving with split-second decision-making, reminiscent of fighting games. As players connect links on a 1010 board, they must anticipate their opponents' moves and react swiftly, creating a thrilling competitive atmosphere. With music that evolves alongside gameplay, SHIKA-Q not only challenges players but also immerses them in a unique audio-visual experience.

As we look forward to the full release planned for Winter 2026, one can't help but wonder how this game will shape the future of competitive puzzle gaming. Will SHIKA-Q become a staple in the esports arena? Only time will tell.
