A recent leak has unveiled 15 minutes of gameplay from the upcoming Battlefield game, showcasing the much-anticipated Rush mode. This mode, familiar to long-time fans of the franchise, pits attackers against defenders in a race to destroy objectives with a limited number of respawns. The gameplay footage, which surfaced from ongoing closed testing, has sparked excitement and curiosity among the gaming community.

Electronic Arts has confirmed that the next installment in the Battlefield series is set for release by March 2026, with a public reveal scheduled for this summer. This marks a shift in EA's approach, as they aim for greater transparency following the mixed reception of Battlefield 2042. With four internal studios collaborating under the Battlefield Studios banner, fans are eager to see how this connected universe will unfold.

As we await more details, the question remains: will this new direction restore faith in the Battlefield franchise? The gaming world is watching closely as EA prepares to unveil more about this promising new title.
