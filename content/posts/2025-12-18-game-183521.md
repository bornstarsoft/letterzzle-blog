In a shocking turn of events, hardware sales and physical game spending in the US experienced their worst November in 30 years, according to market research firm Circana. With only 1.6 million units of video game hardware sold, this marks the lowest total since 1995, highlighting a significant decline in consumer spending during what is typically a bustling shopping month.

November 2025 saw hardware spending plummet to $695 million, a staggering 27% drop compared to the previous year. The average price for a new gaming console reached an all-time high of $439, which likely deterred many potential buyers. Despite the PlayStation 5 leading in sales, the overall market is facing challenges that could reshape the gaming landscape.

As digital sales continue to dominate, the decline in physical software spendingdown 14% year-over-yearraises questions about the future of traditional gaming retail. With manufacturers struggling to lower prices amidst rising component costs, the dedicated gaming device market may face a critical juncture. Will we see a resurgence in hardware sales, or is this the new normal for the gaming industry?
