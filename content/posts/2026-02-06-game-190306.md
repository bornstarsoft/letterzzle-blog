This summer, Konami is set to delight fans with the release of a 13-game Goemon collection for Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PC. Titled "Ganbare Goemon! Daishuugou," this compilation features beloved classics from the Famicom, Super Famicom, and Game Boy eras, bringing nostalgia to both longtime fans and new players alike. However, it appears that this collection will only be available in Japan for now, which raises questions about accessibility for international gamers.

The collection promises exciting new features, including rewind, quick save, turbo buttons, and a music player, enhancing the experience of these classic titles. With games like "The Legend of the Mystical Ninja" and "Ganbare Goemon 3" included, players can expect a mix of humor and engaging gameplay that has defined the series. As Konami also plans to offer a limited-edition package featuring physical items, collectors will have something special to look forward to.

As we anticipate the release on July 2, its worth pondering whether Konami will consider a global launch in the future. Will the charm of Goemon capture the hearts of gamers outside Japan? Only time will tell.
