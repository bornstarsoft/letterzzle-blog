In a recent announcement that has sparked relief among gamers, Gearbox has confirmed that the standard edition of Borderlands 4 will be priced at $70, dispelling earlier concerns about an $80 price tag. This decision comes after CEO Randy Pitchford faced backlash for suggesting that "real fans" would find a way to purchase the game at a higher price. The confirmation of a more accessible price point is a significant move, especially as the gaming industry grapples with rising development costs.

Alongside the standard edition, Gearbox is offering a $130 Super Deluxe Edition, which includes bonus items and DLC, and a $150 Collectorâ€™s Edition that does not include the game itself. This tiered pricing strategy reflects a growing trend in the gaming industry to cater to various consumer preferences while ensuring that fans feel they are receiving value for their money. Additionally, Gearbox has promised exciting post-launch content, including new characters and story missions, which will further enhance the gaming experience.

As we look forward to the release of Borderlands 4 on September 12, 2025, the gaming community is left to ponder: will this pricing strategy set a new standard for future game releases? Only time will tell, but for now, it seems that Gearbox is listening to its fanbase.
