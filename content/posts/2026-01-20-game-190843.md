Japan's console game market has experienced an astonishing growth of 138.8% in 2025, reaching a staggering 418.13 billion yen (approximately $2.64 billion USD). This remarkable surge is largely attributed to the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, which sold nearly 3.8 million units in its debut year. The data, compiled by Kadokawa Game Linkage and Famitsu, highlights the robust demand for both hardware and physical game sales, with hardware sales alone up by 149.3% year-on-year.

The success of titles like Mario Kart World and Pokmon Legends: Z-A, which sold millions of copies, further underscores the impact of the Nintendo Switch 2 on the gaming landscape. With major upcoming releases such as Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and Resident Evil Requiem, the future looks bright for Nintendo and the console gaming market in Japan. Will this momentum continue into 2026, or will new competitors emerge to challenge Nintendo's dominance?
