The Nintendo Switch 2 has taken the gaming world by storm, achieving unprecedented sales figures in Japan. In its first month alone, it sold over 1.5 million units, surpassing the legendary PlayStation 2's initial sales record. This remarkable feat not only highlights the console's popularity but also indicates that it is selling at least three times faster than its predecessor, the original Switch, which sold 556,633 units during the same period.

According to Famitsu, which gathers data from over 3,000 retail stores across Japan, the Switch 2's sales mark the highest for any console since the publication began tracking sales in 1996. With a global sales figure of 3.5 million units in just four days, the Switch 2 is on track to become the fastest-selling Nintendo system ever. As we look ahead, the question remains: can the Switch 2 maintain this momentum and surpass 15 million units in its first year?
