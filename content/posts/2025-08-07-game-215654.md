In a significant move for the gaming community, HoYoverse has officially announced that support for Genshin Impact on the PS4 will come to an end in April 2026. This decision stems from the limitations of hardware performance and platform application size, which have hindered the game's ability to evolve alongside newer technologies. The phased discontinuation will begin with the removal of the PS4 client from the PlayStation Store on September 10, 2025, followed by the delisting of in-game purchases on February 25, 2026, and finally, the cessation of update support on April 8, 2026.

Players who have previously downloaded Genshin Impact will still be able to access the game, but new users will no longer have the option to download it. The good news is that progress will not be lost; players can transition to the PS5 or other supported platforms to continue their adventures. As the gaming landscape shifts, this move highlights the importance of adapting to new technologies to enhance player experience.

As we look towards the future, how will this impact the community and the game's evolution? Will players embrace the transition to next-gen consoles, or will nostalgia for the PS4 linger?
