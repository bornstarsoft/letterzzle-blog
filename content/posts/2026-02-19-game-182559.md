In a recent Ask Me Anything session, Dean Hall, the creator of DayZ and the upcoming game Icarus, urged players to embrace the idea of game delays as a necessary part of the development process. Hall emphasized that players have the power to influence platform holders by expressing their understanding and support for delays, which can ultimately lead to better quality games. He pointed out that the pressure to meet deadlines often leads to a culture of 'crunch' within development teams, which can compromise the quality of the final product.

Hall shared his experiences with various projects, highlighting that many delays stem from a commitment to quality rather than a lack of planning. He believes that when developers communicate openly with their communities, it fosters a healthier relationship and helps manage expectations. By normalizing delays, players can help create an environment where developers feel empowered to take the time they need to deliver polished experiences.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, will we see a shift in how players perceive delays? Perhaps the future of gaming will be defined by quality over speed, thanks to the voices of informed consumers.
