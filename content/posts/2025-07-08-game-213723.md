In a surprising turn of events, Romero Games has publicly denied rumors of its closure following Microsofts recent funding cuts. The studio, known for its innovative approach to first-person shooters, confirmed that while its unannounced project lost funding, it is actively exploring new partnerships with several interested publishers. This news comes after reports suggested that the entire studio was facing layoffs, creating a sense of uncertainty among its employees.

The studio's statement emphasized that it is not closed and is working diligently to secure the future of its projects. They acknowledged the challenges posed by the cancellation of their game but reassured fans and supporters that discussions with potential publishers are ongoing. This proactive approach highlights the resilience of the team and their commitment to bringing their vision to life.

As the gaming industry continues to navigate funding challenges and corporate restructuring, Romero Games stands as a testament to the unpredictability of game development. Will they find the support they need to revive their project? Only time will tell, but their determination is certainly commendable.
