In a surprising twist, it appears that installing all downloadable content (DLC) for Monster Hunter Wilds on PC can significantly enhance game performance. A Reddit user, de_Tylmarande, discovered that their frame rates improved dramatically when logged into an account with all DLC purchased, compared to their own account with just the base game. This anomaly suggests that the games frequent checks for DLC ownership may be causing unnecessary performance issues.

De_Tylmarande's findings indicate that the more DLC a player owns, the fewer checks the game performs, leading to smoother gameplay. They even created a mod to bypass these checks, resulting in frame rates soaring from 20-25 FPS to over 80 FPS. While they caution against using such mods, their experience highlights a potential bug in the games code that Capcom should address to improve the experience for many players.

As we look to the future, it raises an interesting question: will Capcom take action to rectify this issue, or will players continue to seek unofficial workarounds? The gaming community is eager for a resolution that enhances performance without compromising the integrity of the game.
