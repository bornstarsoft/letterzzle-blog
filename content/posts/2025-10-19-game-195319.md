After two decades of anticipation, the legendary game Infinity is finally set to release on the Game Boy Color in Q4 of 2025. This tactical RPG, originally developed by Affinix Software, has captured the hearts of retro gaming fans since its initial cancellation in 2002. With its unique strategic battle system and immersive storyline, Infinity promises to be a remarkable addition to the GBC library, just in time for the holiday season.

The journey of Infinity has been nothing short of extraordinary. Following its initial cancellation, a free ROM version was released in 2016, reigniting interest among fans. Incube8 Games took the initiative to revive the project through a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2021, acquiring the rights and dedicating four years to bring this once-abandoned gem back to life. With five playable characters, over 30 explorable areas, and stunning 8-bit graphics, Infinity is poised to deliver an unforgettable gaming experience.

As we look forward to its release, the excitement surrounding Infinity serves as a testament to the enduring love for retro games. Will this revival inspire a new wave of classic game remakes? Only time will tell.
