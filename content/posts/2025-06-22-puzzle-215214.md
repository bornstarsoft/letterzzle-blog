In a surprising turn of events, Sega has inadvertently disclosed the sales figures for several of its major game franchises, including Sonic, Persona, and Like A Dragon. This revelation came from a presentation document that was uploaded to Sega Sammyâ€™s investor relations website, where a hidden table of sales numbers was discovered. Although the document has since been removed, the figures have been archived, shedding light on the performance of these beloved titles.

According to the leaked data, Persona 5 Royale has impressively sold over 7 million units, showcasing its enduring popularity among fans. Sonic Frontiers also made a notable impact with approximately 4.5 million copies sold. Meanwhile, the latest entries in the Yakuza series, Infinite Wealth and Like A Dragon, have shifted 1.66 million and 2.86 million units, respectively. These numbers not only highlight the success of these franchises but also provide valuable insights into current gaming trends and consumer preferences.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, such accidental revelations can spark discussions about marketing strategies and the competitive landscape. How will Sega leverage these insights to shape future releases? Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: the gaming community is always eager for more data on their favorite titles.
