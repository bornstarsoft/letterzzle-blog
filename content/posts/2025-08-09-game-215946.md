The recent update for Blue Prince on PS5 is a significant step forward for players, addressing crucial save file issues that have plagued the game since its launch. With this patch, save file sizes have been reduced by approximately half, making it easier for players to manage their storage while ensuring a smoother gaming experience. Additionally, the introduction of daily backup save files offers a safety net for those who may not be able to complete a session in one go.

This update not only enhances the overall gameplay but also improves the profile switching speed and rectifies the frustrating save rollback issues that many players encountered. As Blue Prince continues to garner acclaim, with a Metacritic score of 92, these improvements are likely to solidify its status as one of the best-reviewed games of the year. 

As we look ahead, it will be interesting to see how further updates might enhance the gaming experience in Blue Prince and whether it can maintain its momentum among PS Plus subscribers. Are you excited to dive back into the mysterious world of Mt. Holly with these new features?
