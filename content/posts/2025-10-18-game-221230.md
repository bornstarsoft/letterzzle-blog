Recent findings suggest that Pokmon Friends, the latest mobile title, may not be as original as it seems. YouTuber CandyEvie has uncovered striking similarities between Pokmon Friends and a 2016 game called ThinkThink, both developed by Wonderfly. This revelation raises questions about asset flipping and the authenticity of Pokmon Friends, especially given its pricing structure and marketing aimed at a broader audience.

While Pokmon Friends offers a free-to-play model with limited daily puzzles, it also features a hefty price tag for full access. In contrast, ThinkThink employs a subscription model that allows for more flexible gameplay. This difference in monetization strategies highlights the ongoing debate about fairness in mobile gaming, particularly when older puzzle designs are repackaged at a premium.

As gamers, we must consider how these revelations affect our perception of new titles and their value. Are we getting our money's worth, or are we simply paying for nostalgia wrapped in a shiny new package? What do you think about the future of mobile gaming and the ethics of game development?
