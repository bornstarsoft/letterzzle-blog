A new video game based on the iconic horror franchise Friday the 13th is officially in the works, as revealed during a recent San Diego Comic-Con panel. Robert Barsamian, executive vice president at Horror Inc, confirmed that both a sequel game and a new movie are high on their agenda, signaling a resurgence of interest in the franchise that has been dormant for over a decade.

While details remain scarce, Barsamian's acknowledgment of the elephant in the room regarding the lack of new content since the 2009 reboot has fans buzzing with excitement. The previous game, Friday the 13th: The Game, was well-received for its asymmetrical multiplayer gameplay but was pulled from sale at the end of 2023 due to licensing issues. This new project, under the Jason Universe label, aims to bring the franchise into the modern era with fresh experiences and merchandise.

As we await more information, the anticipation builds for what this sequel game will entail. Will it be a direct continuation of the 2017 title, or will it take a new direction? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the hockey-mask-wearing villain is set to make a comeback in the gaming world.
