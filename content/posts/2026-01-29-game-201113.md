Get ready for a nostalgic trip back to the late '90s with Team Afternoon's upcoming game, "Don't You Trust Me?" This innovative free-to-play title, set to launch on February 6, 2026, takes a unique approach to gaming by placing players in the role of a video editor tasked with crafting a perfect "fake clear video" from a chaotic dungeon raid. This concept not only challenges traditional gameplay mechanics but also invites players to engage in a satirical narrative that contrasts the hero's public persona with the messy reality behind the scenes.

At the heart of the game lies an 8-tick timeline editing system, where precision is key. Players must analyze enemy attack patterns and strategically arrange clips of various actions to create a seamless action sequence. This level of detail ensures that every frame counts, making the editing process as thrilling as the gameplay itself. With post-processing VFX features, even the smallest victories can be transformed into epic moments, enhancing the overall experience.

As we look forward to the release, the blend of turn-based strategy, puzzle-solving, and simulation elements promises to captivate gamers who appreciate both humor and challenge. Will you be ready to create the ultimate fake victory?
