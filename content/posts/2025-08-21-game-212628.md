Elden Ring's highly anticipated release on the Nintendo Switch 2 is marred by significant performance issues, raising concerns for fans eager to experience the game on a handheld device. Reports from Gamescom indicate that the game struggles to maintain its maximum framerate of 30fps, with some players experiencing drops as low as 15fps. This raises a red flag for potential buyers who may have expected a seamless gaming experience.

Felix Sanchez from Nintendo Life expressed disappointment, noting that while the graphics look impressive, the gameplay performance is far from satisfactory. The inability to capture gameplay footage, as mandated by publisher Bandai Namco, further fuels speculation about the game's readiness for launch. With the release date still unannounced, players are left wondering if these issues can be resolved in time for a smooth debut.

As Elden Ring continues to captivate audiences worldwide, the question remains: will the Switch 2 version rise to meet the high standards set by its predecessors, or will it falter under the weight of its own ambitions? Only time will tell.
