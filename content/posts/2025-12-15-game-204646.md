The gaming community is buzzing with excitement as the long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, developed by Chris Oberth in 1991, is set to make a triumphant return. Thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation, this unreleased gem will be available as a fully polished cartridge edition, priced at $100. This release not only revives a piece of gaming history but also sheds light on the challenges of preserving 8-bit games and the importance of archival efforts.

The upcoming 2025 release will include an authentic NES cartridge along with a detailed manual that chronicles the game's troubled past and Oberth's career. This initiative highlights the broader conversation about the preservation of video game history, making it a must-have for collectors and enthusiasts alike. With profits supporting the Video Game History Foundation's archival efforts, purchasing Xcavator becomes a way to contribute to the preservation of our digital heritage.

As we look forward to the release of Xcavator, it raises an intriguing question: How many other forgotten games are waiting to be unearthed? The revival of Xcavator is not just about nostalgia; its about recognizing the value of our gaming past and ensuring it remains accessible for future generations.
