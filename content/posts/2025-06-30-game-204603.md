Nintendo has officially announced the release of Drag x Drive for the Nintendo Switch 2, set to launch on August 14, 2025, at a price of $30 AUD. This innovative game allows players to use the Joy-Con controllers in mouse mode, mimicking arm movements to steer and drive a wheelchair in an engaging 3-on-3 basketball format. This unique approach to gameplay not only emphasizes accessibility but also adds a fresh twist to traditional sports gaming.

Having experienced Drag x Drive firsthand at the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in Melbourne, I was pleasantly surprised by how well the mouse controls functioned. The gameplay was far more exhilarating than what I had anticipated from the initial reveal video, showcasing the potential for immersive and interactive gaming experiences on the new console. 

As we approach the release date, excitement is building among gamers eager to try out this unique title. Will Drag x Drive redefine how we think about sports games on consoles? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below!
