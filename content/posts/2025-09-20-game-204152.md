The Nintendo Switch 2 is making waves not just with its impressive hardware but also with the exciting deals on games that are already available. Just a few months after its release, Walmart is offering discounts of up to $20 on popular titles like "Hogwarts Legacy" and "EA Sports Madden NFL 26." This is a great opportunity for gamers to expand their collections without breaking the bank.

With games ranging from open-world RPGs to challenging platformers, the Nintendo Switch 2 is catering to a diverse audience. The fact that many titles are remasters means that fans can enjoy classic games with enhanced features like 4K resolution and GameShare. As prices for new games typically hover around $70 to $80, these discounts signal a promising trend for Switch 2 owners, especially with Black Friday around the corner.

If you're looking to snag some of these deals, don't wait too long. The current offers at Walmart might just be the beginning of a wave of discounts leading into the holiday season. Which game are you most excited to add to your collection?
