The Tokyo Monorail is set to captivate puzzle enthusiasts and fans of the beloved Little Twin Stars with its unique real-world puzzle-solving game, running from November 14, 2025, to February 28, 2026. This engaging event invites participants to embark on a journey along the monorail line, where they will decode a cipher from a letter entrusted by the mascot, Monorun. With two beginner-friendly routes to choose from, this event promises to be a delightful experience for families and friends alike.

Participants can purchase a kit for 2,000 yen, which includes a drawstring pouch, puzzle booklet, clip pen, and discount coupons. The first 1,000 players to join will receive a special ballpoint pen charm, while those who complete both routes will be rewarded with a bonus smartphone wallpaper. This initiative not only promotes local tourism but also adds a layer of interactivity to the travel experience, making it a must-try for tech-savvy adventurers.

As the event coincides with the 50th anniversary of Little Twin Stars, attendees can also enjoy a commemorative photo spot at Haneda Airport Terminal 3 Station. Will you be among the first to solve the puzzles and collect the exclusive rewards?
