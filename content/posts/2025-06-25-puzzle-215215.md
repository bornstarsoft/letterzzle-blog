In a significant turn of events for retro gaming enthusiasts, the Gex Trilogy has been patched and is now fully operational on the Nintendo Switch 2. This update comes after the game was temporarily delisted from the eShop due to compatibility issues stemming from the console's backward compatibility features. Limited Run Games, the publisher behind the title, swiftly addressed the problem, ensuring that players can now enjoy the classic platformer without any hitches.

The patch was approved following a brief hiatus where the game was unavailable for purchase. Players who had previously bought the Gex Trilogy can now download the update and dive back into the nostalgic world of Gex. This resolution not only restores access to the game but also highlights the importance of timely updates in the gaming industry, especially for titles relying on modern emulation engines like Limited Run's Carbon Engine.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, the swift response from Limited Run Games serves as a reminder of the challenges and triumphs that come with reviving classic titles for new platforms. Will we see more retro games making a comeback with similar updates in the future? Only time will tell.
