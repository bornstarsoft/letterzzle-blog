Gamirror Games has unveiled an intriguing new title, AiliA, a visual mirror-based puzzle game that promises to challenge players' spatial awareness and creativity. Set to launch on January 9, 2026, this 3D puzzle-adventure invites players to step into the shoes of Aria, a young girl on a quest to rescue her twin sister from a world trapped behind glass. The unique gameplay mechanics revolve around manipulating mirrors to reshape the environment, transforming reflections into tangible pathways and interactive elements.

With seven visually distinct stages inspired by Eastern aesthetics and over 100 meticulously crafted puzzles, AiliA aims to offer an immersive experience that encourages deep exploration and mastery. The inclusion of hidden levels adds an extra layer of challenge for those who thrive on uncovering secrets. As players navigate through this enchanting mirrored world, they will not only solve puzzles but also unravel a deeper narrative woven into the fabric of the game.

A playable demo is currently available on Steam, allowing players to get a taste of the innovative gameplay ahead of its official release. Will AiliA redefine the puzzle genre with its captivating mechanics and storytelling? Only time will tell, but its certainly a title to keep an eye on in the coming months.
