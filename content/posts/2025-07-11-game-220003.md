Rare has officially announced that paid custom servers will be introduced to Sea of Thieves in early 2026. This exciting development was revealed during the games first community direct, titled Custom Seas. Players will soon have the opportunity to create their own private gaming experiences, complete with exclusive tools like the cinematic camera used for game trailers. While specific pricing details remain under wraps, Rare has indicated that these servers will come with a monthly fee due to the costs associated with supporting such a feature.

In addition to the custom servers, Rare is also revamping the games seasonal model. Starting with Season 17, each season will last three months and be divided into three distinct phases: the first month will focus on reinvigorating the sandbox gameplay, the second will highlight live events, and the third will emphasize community engagement. This structured approach aims to address the recent stagnation in the games momentum and keep players engaged.

As we look forward to these changes, its clear that Rare is committed to enhancing the Sea of Thieves experience. Will these new features reignite the passion of the player community?
