In a world where creativity knows no bounds, the story of 8-year-old Joey Reyes and her short film about avocado toast serves as a delightful reminder of how simple ideas can lead to profound artistic expressions. Joey's 55-second morality play, featuring her stuffed avocado toy as a silent judge, showcases the power of storytelling through the lens of childhood imagination. This charming film, presented at the Like You Childrens Film Festival, highlights how young filmmakers can convey complex themes in a playful and engaging manner.

Joeys film not only entertains but also encourages other children to explore their creativity and share their unique perspectives. Its a testament to the fact that filmmaking can be a powerful medium for self-expression, even for the youngest among us. As we look ahead, one has to wonder: what other innovative stories are waiting to be told by the next generation of filmmakers?
