Remedy Entertainment has officially announced Control Resonant, the highly anticipated sequel to the critically acclaimed game Control. Set to release in 2026, this new installment will follow Dylan Faden, the brother of the original games protagonist, as he navigates a reimagined Manhattan transformed by a cosmic invasion. This expansive world promises to challenge players with its reality-warping mechanics and a deep progression system that allows for unique ability customization.

In Control Resonant, players will not only traverse visually stunning environments but also confront ever-evolving threats using elemental powers and a shapeshifting melee weapon known as the Aberrant. Directed by seasoned Remedy veteran Mikael Kasurinen, the game aims to elevate the series' signature blend of action and storytelling into a more ambitious and immersive experience. With Annapurna Pictures co-financing the project, fans can expect a polished and engaging journey that is accessible to newcomers while still rewarding for returning players.

As we look forward to 2026, the excitement surrounding Control Resonant is palpable. Will this sequel redefine the boundaries of action RPGs? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: players are in for a wild ride.
