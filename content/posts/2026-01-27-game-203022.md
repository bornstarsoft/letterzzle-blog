In an intriguing turn of events, Walmart may have inadvertently revealed two unannounced GameCube titles set to join the Nintendo Switch Online service. Social media users have spotted a listing on Walmart's website featuring classic games, including Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2, which have yet to be officially announced by Nintendo. This leak raises questions about the future of the GameCube library on the Switch, especially as fans eagerly await more classic titles.

Currently, the Nintendo Switch Online service offers a limited selection of GameCube games, with only eight titles available to Switch 2 users. Nintendo has confirmed three upcoming titles: Super Mario Sunshine, Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Pokmon Colosseum, but no release dates have been provided. The excitement surrounding the potential addition of Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2 could signal a broader strategy to enhance the GameCube offerings, especially given the recent remaster of the original Metroid Prime.

As we look ahead, the anticipation builds for what other classic titles Nintendo might bring to the Switch Online service. Will we see more beloved GameCube games make their way to the platform? Only time will tell, but for now, fans can dream of revisiting these iconic titles.
