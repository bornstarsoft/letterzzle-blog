Sega has officially announced the Puyo Puyo Global Ranking Series 2025, marking a significant milestone in the world of competitive puzzle gaming. With over 39 million players globally, this tournament circuit aims to crown the first-ever world champion of Puyo Puyo, a beloved tile-matching puzzler. This initiative not only highlights the game's popularity but also solidifies its status as a serious esport, backed by a publisher-driven tournament structure.

The Puyo Puyo Global Ranking Series features a comprehensive point system that rewards players for participating in various online tournaments, including some organized by Sega and others from the grassroots community. This inclusive approach mirrors successful tournament circuits in the fighting game community, such as the Capcom Pro Tour and the Tekken World Tour, fostering a competitive environment that encourages players from all regions to showcase their skills.

As we look forward to the Puyo Puyo Gran Prix Final in February 2026, it's exciting to see how this new competitive scene will evolve. Will it inspire more puzzle games to embrace the esports model? The future of competitive gaming is bright, and Puyo Puyo is leading the charge.
